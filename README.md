# DeFi Arbitrage 

This initiative focuses on implementing an innovative arbitrage technique that finds arbitrage potential between two DeFi platforms and conducts the necessary trade.

Currently, the system can identify triangular arbitrage opportunities throughout various swap exchanges, utilizing flash swaps to execute trades of any value.

Though the project is primed for BSC mainnet addresses, it can operate on any EVM-compatible chain.
